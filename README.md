## Hi, I’m Andrey — system builder and operator

I help turn messy ideas, teams, and processes into working systems.

I’ve spent 20+ years fixing and rebuilding businesses from the inside:
from launching retail networks and leading large tech teams
to operating at C-level and transforming organizations with thousands of employees.

Today I focus on **early-stage systems**:
- startups that need real signals instead of illusions,
- markets where AI can replace 80% of routine work,
- decisions that matter more than frameworks.

### Current focus
- **AI Launch OS (AILOS)** — a hands-on system for startup discovery and execution
- **Cyprus Real Estate** — applied AI and analytics for valuation and investment decisions
- Selective founder support as an operator / tracking partner

This repository is a **working log**, not a blog.
You’ll find how decisions are made — and why some paths are killed.
