üëã Hi, I'm Andrey.

I have over 20 years of experience in IT, working as both a specialist and a manager in programming and infrastructure. I have applied ITIL, COBIT, and TOGAF frameworks and used AGILE/SCRUM methodologies before they became mainstream. Through working in various industries, I've developed an understanding of how to leverage technology to benefit business and how to drive business growth through IT. I enjoy figuring out how things work, staying at the forefront of the latest technologies, and getting hands-on when it makes sense. I thrive on creating something new in startups or medium-sized businesses and dislike being just a cog in a large bureaucratic machine.

<br><br>Lately, I've been focused on driving exponential company growth and applying Data Science and AI to traditional industries, such as Real Estate Investment.

<br><br>Below are a few examples of how I have personally used Data Science to drive business development:

Some more about me:

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in driving the growth of high-tech businesses through advancements in computer and modern technologies, including applications, software, data management, and more. 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm seeking collaboration opportunities with developers and data analysts. Additionally, I‚Äôm keen on connecting with representatives from the Real Estate market, although I harbor skepticism about their awareness of this resource. This skepticism underscores why the Real Estate sector serves as a quintessential example of a traditional, conservative market...
